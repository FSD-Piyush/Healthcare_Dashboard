[Power BI, SQL, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence]

- Utilized Power BI features like **slicers** for date ranges and **formatted visuals** (column charts, donut charts) to monitor **bed occupancy** and **doctor ratings/feedback.**
- Customized billing data in **INR**, making the dashboard region-specific, and included dynamic filters to allow for seamless healthcare data exploration.
- Created a comprehensive visual layout using **themes and formatting tools** in Power BI, ensuring the dashboard was functional, visually cohesive, and easy to interpret.
